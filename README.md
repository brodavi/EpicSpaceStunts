# Epic Space Stunts:

built with the Ash entity framework [as ported to Haxe by nadako](https://github.com/nadako/Ash-HaXe) and built off of code from the Asteroids example project by [Richard Lord](http://github.com/richardlord/)

## Notes:

Epic Space Stunts is based on the game of Asteroids. When I played
Asteroids as a kid, I always liked narrowly dodging asteroids more
than shooting them. I would put myself in harrowing situations, and
onlookers would cheer when I somehow avoided crashing. I wanted to
capture that alternative game mechanic, and offer it as the main goal
of the game.
